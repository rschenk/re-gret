# Re-gret Keyboard

The Re-gret is a 34 key remix of my [Egret](https://github.com/rschenk/egret) keyboard.

Featuring: 34 keys, Choc spacing, Choc v1 hot swappable, Seeed Xiao MCU, wireless compatible, RGB undeglow when plugged in, and a silicone gasket sandwich stackup.

Compared to the original Egret, besides having two thumb buttons per side, the Re-gret has a more angle between the halves, and the ring and pinky fingers have more stagger and more splay. It also has a Xiao MCU which is cheaper and cuter than a Nice Nano. Certainly a more re-fined re-mix that I have no re-grets about making.

## Build guide

Check the docs for a [PCB Build Guide](docs/pcb_build_guide.md) and [Case Build Guide](docs/case_build_guide.md).

## RGB Underglow

I powered the RGB underglow directly from the USB 5v, so it will automagically turn itself off when in wireless bluetooth mode. There's no need for ZMK's [External Power Control](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/power#external-power-control) because you physically can't run the LEDs from battery power even if you wanted to. There's a [clever trick](https://hackaday.com/2017/01/20/cheating-at-5v-ws2812-control-to-use-a-3-3v-data-line/) using a diode that allows the 5v LEDs to be controlled by the Xiao's 3.3v logic.

## Firmware

### ZMK

I've published the firmware for Re-gret as a ZMK module: [rschenk/zmk-keyboard-re-gret](https://github.com/rschenk/zmk-keyboard-re-gret), which is (probably?) the preferred method for adding the keyboard in ZMK.

If you don't use modules, or prefer the old school way, then copy the contents of `firmware/zmk/config/boards/shields/regret/` into `[your-zmk-config]/config/boards/shields/regret/`

Be advised that right now the underglow only works on the XIAO nRF52840 board, and does not work on the XIAO RP2040 (although it [might in the future](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/issues/1085)). The original XIAO SAMD21 should work but I haven't tested it.

### QMK

Copy the contents of `firmware/qmk/keyboards/re_gret` into `[your_qmk_firmware]/keyboards/re_gret`, since I have not put the Re-gret firmware into the official QMK repo.

Only the XIAO RP2040 is supported. The Adafruit QT Py RP2040 might possibly work but I don't think the reset button will function.
